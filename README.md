# Export music titles to audio files

To save individual titles from the recorded radio broadcasts as an audio file, first click on the "Recordings" button at the top left and select the desired recording. Then click on the "Export" button at the bottom to show the controls needed for setting start/end time, the filename and export format.

Locate the start of the title you want to export. If the radio station the audio file was recorded from supports icecast you already have a playlist. Just click on the title and you are almost done. Often the displayed start time does not exactly correspond with the title start, in which case some fine tuning is still to be done.

* To set the export name and start time hold the \<Ctrl\> key and select the title from the playlist
* Enter/edit the export name and set the two timestamps on the left-hand side of the input field.
* To set the start time hold the \<Ctrl\> key and click on the left timestamp
* To set the end time hold the \<Ctrl\> key and click on the right timestamp
* To verify the position click on the start/end timestamp while playing
* Select .mp3 (in most cases) or .aac depending on the stream format
* Finally click on the green "Export" button

The exported audio file will be stored in your streaming directory. Click on the "Exports" button at the upper left to get a list of your exports. Click again to refresh the list.

# Cut & export to video files

Exporting movies, scenes or sequences works in pretty much the same way as with audio files. Enter title, set start/end time, select .mp4 (in most cases) or .ts as export  format and finally click on the green "Export" button.

# Editing the playlist
Click on the "Title" button at the bottom to show the controls needed for adding, deleting and editing playlist titles.

* To edit/copy/delete a title hold the \<Ctrl\> key and select the title from the playlist
* To delete the title click on the red "Delete" button
* If needed: To set the title time seek to new position, hold the \<Ctrl\> key and click on the timestamp. To verify the position click on the timestamp while playing
* Edit the title and commit with \<Enter\> or cancel with \<Esc\>
* To add a new title click on the green "Add" button

All changes to the playlist can be done while recording. There is no backup or undo - so be careful.
